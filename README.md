The project aims to create a comprehensive Authentication and Role-based Permissions system. It is designed to provide a secure and flexible user management solution for web applications. The primary goal is to allow administrators to manage user roles and permissions easily, enabling fine-grained control over what different user types can access and do within the application.

Key features of the project include:

- User registration and authentication: Users can sign up for accounts and log in securely.
- Role management: Administrators can create, update, and delete roles such as Admin, Employee, and Manager.
- Permission assignment: Roles can be assigned specific permissions, determining what actions users with those roles can perform.
- User management: Administrators can manage user accounts, including adding, editing, and deleting users.
- Access control: The system enforces access control based on user roles and permissions, restricting unauthorized actions.
- Secure authentication: Passwords are securely hashed and stored, and authentication is protected against common security vulnerabilities.

Overall, the project aims to simplify user management and enhance security in web applications by implementing a robust Authentication and Role-based Permissions system.
